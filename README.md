# quotes
quotes is a small AngularJS RESTful application with a Couchbase backend.<br> Credits to draptik for his angularrestful ngdemo which was very helpful during the creation of this project.

Notes:
Couchbase - I use the default bucket and cluster all the time.<br>
CRUD - So far no Delete, and Create/Update is the same function (handled by Couchbase backend).
